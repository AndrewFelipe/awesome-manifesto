# Manifesto [![ghit.me](https://ghit.me/badge.svg?repo=cristaloleg/manifesto)](https://ghit.me/repo/cristaloleg/manifesto)
### Git
- 1 commit per change, do squash
  - you can easily work with changes 
- touch few things at once
  - it's kinda obvious
- rebase instead of merge
  - no merge commits, cleaner git history
- pull request must have 2+ approvals
  - changes must be visible to the team members
- master is read-only
  - it's a rule. always. no exclusions.
- delete branches after a merge
  - better navigation and git performance
- release tags
  - tracking releases/deployments are simpler
- git submodules for components
  - better architecture consistency
- no global history changes
  - prevents git history misuse

### CI
- auto revert on failure
  - no broken code in the master
- run at any commit
  - the obvious ability for CI
- CI plan in git
  - know all plan changes and have consistency
- warn about formatting verification
  - no developer disruption in the future
- warn about coverage illness
  - coverage is quite important thing
- track test(flakiness) failures
  - statistics, hints, conclusions
- store build logs for 3+ months
  - having analytics and working links to them
- docs are generated from the code
  - end-user changes must be explicit

### Code health
- use linters and code analysis all the time
  - the best handling for the best code
- fork instead of hack
  - logic isolation at the beginning
- touch legacy, often
  - it becomes non-legacy faster
- remove deprecated stuff
  - having a bloated dead code is an error
- use TODO, BUG, XXX in code
  - jumping to the issue tracker can be minimised

### Dependencies
- bump libs on a permanent basis
  - the new version is expected to be better
- have a local cache-server with deps
  - adds stability to the infrastructure
- all modules must have the same structure
  - similar environment everywhere is a good idea

### Tests
- use one test framework
  - similar environment is better
- show results, not just stack traces
  - some failures are obvious with visible result

### Tools
- use Makefile, Bash
  - simple, easy, well known

### Recovery
- use partial backups
  - restoring from the 10+Gb file is kinda strange
- test your backups
  - they might be broken

### Team
- pairing, 50% and more
  - you're doing better, you're not bored
- high-level stand-ups, time bounded
  - less info about irrelevant stuff
- 2-3 week sprints
  - have an achievable sprint goal
- per sprint roles
  - it's quite comfortable time bounds
- only urgent topics are face-to-face
  - fewer distractions for unimportant things

### Meetings
- I can skip if I'm out of scope
  - do not waste team and own time
- if you're organising a meeting - prepare an agenda
  - to have a way how to drive a meeting

### Communications
- use the best apps
  - fast, flexible, pleasurable
- outcomes of important discussions should be on a wiki
  - better visibility for outcomes
- only important notifications
  - @all should be rare for irrelevant updates
- easy access to any team room
  - that's obvious, hey
- do not delete personal chats with inactive users
  - some chats contains interesting ideas

### Permissions
- Git, CI, SSH read-access to everything
  - reading server logs cannot cause troubles
- SSO to anything
  - better organisation of credentials
- each office should have global admin
  - different timezones are bottleneck

### Space
- engineers apart from non-engineers
  - fire & ice
- quite open-space
  - someone might be sensitive to a noise...
- quite zones
  - ...really sensitive
- the kitchen isn't for chill-out
  - the play room is a thing

### Network
- VPN access from home
  - work from home is a cool thing
- Wifi must work all the time
  - obvious
- LAN must be even more stable
 Â - uber-obvious

### Life
- work from home is a must have
  - family, health, even weather might be a reason 
- educational budget to anything related to dev stuff
  - I would like to learn new technologies, why not?
- allow committing to the open-source
  - company_karma++
- skipping team lunch must be acceptable
  - well...obvious
